### Cyclistic
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. <br>
Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering *reclining bikes, hand tricycles*, and c*argo bikes*, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
**8%** of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about **30%** use them to
commute to work each day. <br>
 
**Cyclistic’s** has three types of pricing plans: **single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships**.Customers who purchase *single-ride* or f*ull-day passes* are referred to as **casual riders**. Customers
who purchase *annual memberships* are **Cyclistic members**.
 
 
Company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships as annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.
 
We wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
 
### Goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 
 
In order to do that, however, we need to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.
 
 
### Key Findings
- On weekends, casual riders' demand on bikes are larger than members.
- Casual riders prefer to take longer trips averaging 26 minutes per trip compared to members who average only 13 minutes.
- Average trip duration of casual riders is more than twice that of member rider over any given day of the week cumulatively.
- During the day, averagely, **12 PM to 7 PM** is the peak time when number of rides of casual riders are greater than 150K.
- Top three start stations for casual riders are **1) Streeter Dr & Grand Ave**, **2) Millennium Park** **3) Michigan Ave & Oak St**

## Recommendations
- Saturday is effective in case of casual riders whereas it is the most effective day for marketing and we can bring some discount or promotion package.
- In July there is a peak in numbers of rides so promotion and packages for membership is recommended at that time.
- We can introduce Weekend Pass for casual riders as we have more casual riders on weekend.
- Offer discounted pricing during non-busy hours so that casual riders might choose to use bikes more often and level out demand over the day.
- We can introduce Premium Pass service for Bike reservation during peek Biking seasons.
