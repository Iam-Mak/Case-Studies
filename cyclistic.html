									<h1>How Does a Bike-Share <br />
										Navigate Speedy Success? </h1>
									<p>Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cyc.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>Cyclistic </h2>
								<p>In 2016,<b>Cyclistic </b>  launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.
									Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day </p>
                              <p> Cyclistic’s has three types of pricing plans: <b>single-ride passes,full-day passes,</b> and <b>annual memberships</b>. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.</p>
							  <h2>Goal</h2>
							  <p> Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. </p>
							  <h2>Key Findings</h2>

							  <ul>
								  <li> Casual riders prefer to take longer trips averaging 26 minutes per trip compared to members who average only 13 minutes.</li>
								  <li> On weekends, casual riders' demand on bikes are larger than members. </li>
								  <li> Average trip duration of casual riders is more than twice that of member rider over any given day of the week cumulatively.</li>
								 
								  <li>During the day, averagely, 12 PM to 7 PM is the peak time when number of rides of casual riders are greater than 150K. </li>
								  <li> Top three start stations for casual riders are
									   <ol>
										<li>  Streeter Dr & Grand Ave </li>
										<li>  Millennium Park </li>
										<li>  Michigan Ave & Oak St</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								  

							  </ul>

							  <h2> Recommendations </h2>
							  <ul>
								<li> Saturday is effective in case of casual riders whereas it is the most effective day for marketing and we can bring some discount or promotion package.</li>
								<li> In July there is a peak in numbers of rides so promotion and packages for membership is recommended at that time. </li>
								<li> We can introduce Weekend Pass for casual riders as we have more casual riders on weekend. </li>
								  <li> Offer discounted pricing during non-busy hours so that casual riders might choose to use bikes more often and level out demand over the day.</li>
								  <li>We can introduce Premium Pass service for Bike reservation during peek Biking seasons. </li>
