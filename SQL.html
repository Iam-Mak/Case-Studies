								<h1> When Was the Golden Age of Video Games? </h1>

							<h2>Video Games</h2>
							<p>
							Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than <b>$300 billion</b> by 2027 according to 
							<a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-gaming-market">Mordor Intelligence</a>
							
							. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed? 	</p>
							<p>
							In this project, I'll explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. I'll compare a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.
						</p>
							
						  <h2>Objective </h2>

						  <p> Exploration of the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. </p>
						  <h2> Findings</h2>

						  <ul>
							  <li> Best Years for games according to critics score are 1990,1992 and 1998</li>
							  <li> Best years for games according to both critics and players are 2008,1998 and 2002.</li>
							  <li> Total Games sold in best years are  175.07, 101.52, 58.67 millions.</li>

									<h1> Exploration of Covid-19 Cases in BigQuery </h1>
									<p> <b> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</b> is an infectious disease caused by the <b>SARS-CoV-2 virus</b> .</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/covid.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>Coronavirus </h2>
								<p>Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. </p>
                              <p> The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.</p>
							  <p> The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.</p>
							  <h2>Objective </h2>
							  <p> Exploration of Covid 19 cases in BigQuery (SQL) and Google Data Studio  </p>
							  <h2> Findings</h2>

							  <ul>
								  <li> United States has the highest infection rate followed by India. </li>
								  <li> Faroe Islands has the highest frequency of COVID-19 in Europe with 62.32 % of infected population. </li>
								  <li> Europe is the most affected continent followed by North America. </li>
								 
								  <li> United States, India and Brazil have the highest total death count.    </li>
