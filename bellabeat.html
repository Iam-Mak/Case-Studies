						<h2>Goal</h2>

						 <p> Analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices in order to present high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
						</p>
						<p>
							<h2> Key insights</h2>

							<ul>
							  <li>The majority of users do not take enough steps to be considered active.</li>
							  <li>Invest in additional data capture techniques as current datasets provide a small sample size and do not include any demographic details.</li>
							  <li> The Sedentary minutes is around 983.5 which is fairly high compare to others.</li>
							  <li>Users are most active between 12pm and 2pm (lunchtime) and from 5pm till 7pm (after work) on weekdays.</li>
							  <li>People are more likely to spend their time in bed rather than they fell asleep. </li>
							 
							</ul> 
						</p>
						<h2> Recommendations </h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Bellabeat can focus on people with health problems such as (diabetes, high blood pressure) and help them to monitor their health with smart gadgets.</li>
							<li>Bellabeat can also involve our company with athletes' intelligence and help them to analyze their overall performance.</li>
							<li>Bellabeat can increase user's engagement by motivating them to participate in competitions or by goal - setting activities and we can also help them by sneding reminders on the phone.</li>
							<li>Create wellness guides within the app to inform strategies for workout and give exercise recommendations based on lifestyle.</li>

							<li>Bellabeat can implement some step goal rewards for the people who achieved more steps thoughtout the week.</li>
