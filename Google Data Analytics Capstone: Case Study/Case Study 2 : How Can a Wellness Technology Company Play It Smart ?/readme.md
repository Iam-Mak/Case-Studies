Using this information, give high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

### 1. Ask
Analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. 
- 1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
- 2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
- 3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

### 2. Prepare
[FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain): This Kaggle data set
contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of
personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. 
- 18 csv Files
- This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03/12/2016 - 05/12/2016.

#### 2.1 Limitations of Data Set:
- Data collected from year 2016. Users' daily activity, fitness and sleeping habits, diet and food consumption may have changed since then, hence data may not be timely or relevant.
- Sample size of 33 female FitBit users is not representative of the entire female population.
- As data is collected in a survey, hence unable to ascertain the integrity or accuracy of data.

#### 2.2 Is Data ROCCC?
A good data source is **ROCCC** which stands for **Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current,** and **Cited**.

- **Reliable -** *LOW* - Not reliable as it only has 33 respondents
- **Original -** *LOW* - Third party provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk)
- **Comprehensive** - *MED* - Parameters match most of Bellabeat's products' parameters
- **Current** - *LOW* - Data is more than 5 years old and is not relevant
- **Cited** - *LOW* - Data collected from third party, hence unknown
